# From Shaz:

I want you to build a small demo app. Just one screen.  

It will be a 4 full screen photo slider (slide left right to see the photo gallery).

it will have a small panel of text at the bottom (which is translucent).  When you slide that box up with your finger, it will grow to have an almost full screen of text  on the screen.  When you slide it down it hides back to the original state as per the first screen.

Hope that makes sense. It shouldn't take you long - do give me an idea of how long it DOES take you. Maybe show me the results on iOS simulator video or Skype.

Call me with any issues or if you want me to explain it further. I would like to see the code and project once done.

This would form the basic foundation of the new swipe screen. 

Just use any dummy text/photos. It is more the structure and how you do it which  is important to me.
